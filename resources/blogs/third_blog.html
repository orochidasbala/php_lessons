        Holi is a popular Indian festival of love and spring. The festival celebrates the eternal and divine love of Radha Krishna, and signifies the triumph of good over evil, as it celebrates the victory of Vishnu over Hiranyakashipu. This photograph depicts the celebration of Lathmar Holi at Radha Rani Temple in Barsana, India, with devotees throwing gulal (coloured powder) at each other as a celebration of love and equality.
